Part 1 Meeting Planning Information:
Meeting: Sat 4/1 @ 4pm on Discord
    Focus: 
        -> RushHour Class constructor
        -> possible hashing for possMove algorithm
        -> Game play design for CLI class
        -> Assign Outstanding tasks

    Task/Coding Division:
        -> Coding RushHourCLI = Lennard
        -> Coding RushHour Methods:
            -- Constructor (file parser) = Emma -- DONE
            -- moveVehicle = Daphne -- DONE
            -- getPossibleMoves = Emma - doing later tonight - DONE
            -- toString (printing game board) = Lennard -- DONE

        -> Unit Testing:
            -- Direction (enum) = Emma - DONE
            -- Move (class) create a toString in the class 1st = Emma
            -- Position (class) = Emma - DONE
            -- Vehicle (class) = Daphne - DONE
            -- RushHour (class) = Lenny - DONE
            **CLI does NOT need to be tested via Unit Tests

            - vehicleFrontButton & moveVehicleForwards() (event handler method) = Lennard >> DONE
            - vehicleBackButton & moveVehicleBackwards() (event handler method) = Lennard >> DONE
            - vehicleMoved() (concrete observer method - updates board after vehicle moved) = Emma

    -- RushHourSolver (class) = Emma

-> Update the Views
    -- Update CLI (class) to use the Backtracker solve() = Lennard
